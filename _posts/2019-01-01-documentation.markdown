knowledgebase

We expect the following for a great SaaS documentation provider:
-   Search should be front and center in the design
-   Content should be ezasily categorizable and  of the content
-   A visual redesign to alignment with your brand
-  Better product onboarding

ZenDesk, FreshDesk, HelpScout, Desk.com etc. These products are great when it comes to ticketing/help desk capabilities but their self-service documentation comes with a lot of gaps.
